# Hi!

My name is Niels, and I program from time to time, mostly in Python.

I use this space to showcase some of the projects I've done, some professionally, and some as a hobby. Most of it is hosted in private repositories, but I hope to provide some insight into what I like to do through this page. You can contact me on gmail.



**KomKom Admin**

I wrote this piece of administration software freelance, for a friend who brews [Kombutcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha) and needed some help organizing his ingredient purchases, batch production, sales, taxes etc. Some graphs and a pdf export function are also included. All data you see here is dummy data.

**Robots**

I've built a small robot, with a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino at the center. It streams video and sonar data back to my control center, which you can see in this screenshot:

**PirateFlix**

A torrent streaming GUI, using [PeerFlix](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix) and [TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). Used to search and stream video.
